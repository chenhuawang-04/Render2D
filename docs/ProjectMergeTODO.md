# ProjectMergeTODO

This document tracks decisions and cleanup items that matter when Render2D is merged into the host engine.

## 1. ECS framework exists only for tests

The temporary ECS framework in this repository exists only under `tests/support/`.

It is used to validate Render2D components and systems before integration. It is not the production ECS and should be replaced by the host engine ECS during merge.

Relevant temporary files:

- `tests/support/TemporaryEcsStorage.hpp`
- `tests/support/ComponentStreamView.hpp`

Production systems should continue to consume component streams through non-owning boundaries such as `std::span`, not through the temporary test ECS storage.

## 2. Resource references exposed to ECS use id + generation

Render2D native resource references exposed to ECS use an `id + generation` pattern.

Examples:

- `BufferRef::buffer_id + BufferRef::generation`
- `ImageRef::image_id + ImageRef::generation`
- `PipelineRef::pipeline_id + PipelineRef::generation`

Reason:

- ECS components may outlive the native resource slot they reference.
- `generation` lets runtime code reject stale references after slot reuse.
- IDs remain compact and directly indexable by native runtime tables.

Native runtime owns actual Vulkan objects. ECS components only store POD references.
